Overview
========

In this three-part workshop series you will learn the basics of text mining
with Python. We will focus primarily on unstructured text data, discussing how
to format and clean text to enable the discovery of significant patterns in
collections of documents. Sessions will introduce participants to core
terminology in text mining/natural language processing and will walk through
different methods of ranking terms and documents. We will conclude by using
these methods to classify texts and to build models of "topics." Basic
familiarity with Python is required. We welcome students, postdocs, faculty,
and staff from a variety of research domains, ranging from health informatics
to the humanities.

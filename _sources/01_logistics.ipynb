    "\n",
    "+ Prepare textual data for analysis using a variety of cleaning processes\n",
    "+ Recognize and explain how these cleaning processes impact research findings\n",
    "+ Explain key terminology in text mining, including \"tokenization,\" \"n-grams,\" \"lexical diversity,\" and more\n",
    "+ Use special data structures (such as document-term matrices) to efficiently analyze multiple texts\n",
    "+ Use statistical measures (pointwise mutual information, tf-idf) to identify significant patterns in text\n",
    "+ Cluster and classify texts on the basis of such measures\n",
    "+ Produce statistical models of \"toics\" from/about a collection of texts\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using Google Colab's platform and Google Drive during the series and working with a set of \n",
    "pre-configured notebooks and data. You must have a Google account to work in the Colab environment. Perform the \n",
    "following steps to setup your environment for the course:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the data that you'll need today by clicking on the following link: [https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/tm\\_workshop\\_data.zip](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/tm_workshop_data.zip)\n",
    "2. Un-compress the downloaded .zip file by double clicking on it\n",
    "3. Visit the Google Colab website at [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign-in using your Google account\n",
    "4. In a separate browser tab (from the one where you are logged-in to Colab) sign-in to your Google Drive\n",
    "5. Upload the `tm_workshop_data` directory into the root of your Google Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the above steps, you will have your basic environment setup. Next, you'll need to create a \n",
    "blank notebook in Google Colab. To do this, go to Google Colab and choose \"File->New Notebook\" from the File \n",
    "Menu. Alternatively, select \"New Notebook\" in the bottom right corner of the notebooks pop-up if it appears in your window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you need to connect your Google Drive to your Colab environment. To do this, run the following code in the \n",
    "code cell at appears at the top of your blank notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from google.colab import drive\n",
    "drive.mount('/gdrive')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your environment should be ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Template code\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is hands-on, and you're encouraged to code alongside the instructors. That said, we'll also start \n",
    "each session with some template code from the session before. You can find these templates in this [start script] \n",
    "directory. Simply copy/paste the code from the `.txt` files into your Jupyter environment.\n",
